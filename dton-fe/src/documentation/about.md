## Digital Twin of News

The Digital Twin of News concept is a demonstration of a fusion of multi-lingual news data, Earth Observation imagery from various sensors, machine learning, and remote sensing techniques, which can provide important context and an interactive experience.

The project is designed and funded by the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/) and implemented by [Sinergise](https://www.sinergise.com/en/what-we-do), supported by [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/about/) services for satellite data processing and [Event Registry](https://eventregistry.org/about) for extracting relevant information from millions of news coming from hundreds of thousands of sources.
